# navber

This folder contains a small static HTML/CSS starter site.

Files added:

- `index.html` — a simple responsive page with a CSS-only navbar.
- `css/styles.css` — styles for layout, navbar and responsive behavior.

How to view locally

Open `index.html` in your browser directly, or run a lightweight static server from this folder:

```bash
# from this folder (Git Bash / WSL / bash)
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

If you want changes (logo, links, colors, add sections or convert to React/Vue), tell me what framework or features you prefer and I can implement them.
